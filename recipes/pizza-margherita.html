    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza always makes a bad day feel better, and there's nothing nicer than a
      perfect slice of margherita pizza. Now you can make this recipe at home
      any time the craving strikes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pizza margherita, as the Italians call it, is a simple pizza hailing from
      Naples. When done right, margherita pizza features a bubbly crust, crushed
      San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil, a drizzle of olive
      oil, and a sprinkle of salt. That is all.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the base</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Plain Flour Type 00 - 900gr</li>
      <li>Salt - 3 Teaspoon</li>
      <li>Sugar - 2 Teaspoon</li>
      <li>Fresh East - 15gr</li>
      <li>Water - 450ml</li>
      <li>Extra virgin Olive Oil - Half Glass</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the condiment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Tomato Passata - 500ml</li>
      <li>Basil</li>
      <li>Extra virgin Olive Oil</li>
      <li>Mozzarella - 1kg</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper
        third of the oven. If you're using a baking stone or baking steel, place
        it on the upper rack. Prepare dough through step 5.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a medium mixing bowl in the sink and pour the canned tomatoes into
        the bowl, juices and all. Crush the tomatoes by hand. Spread about ¾ cup
        of the tomato sauce evenly over each pizza, leaving about 1 inch bare
        around the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your mozzarella is packed in water, drain off the water and gently
        pat the mozzarella dry on a clean tea towel or paper towels. If you're
        working with large mozzarella balls, tear them into smaller 1-inch
        balls. Distribute the mozzarella over the pizza, concentrating it a bit
        more in the center of the pizza, as it will melt toward the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and
        the cheese is just turning golden, about 10 to 12 minutes (or
        significantly less, if you're using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on
        it).
      </li>
      <li>
        Top each pizza generously with fresh basil, followed by a light
        back-and-forth drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkling of salt, and red
        pepper flakes, if you wish. Slice and enjoy. Leftover pizza will keep
        well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
      </li>
    </ol>
